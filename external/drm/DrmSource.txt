drm/tegra: Changes for v5.15-rc1

The bulk of these changes is a more modern ABI that can be efficiently
used on newer SoCs as well as older ones. The userspace parts for this
are available here:

  - libdrm support: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/tagr/drm/-/commits/drm-tegra-uabi-v8
  - VAAPI driver: https://github.com/cyndis/vaapi-tegra-driver

In addition, existing userspace from the grate reverse-engineering
project has been updated to use this new ABI:

  - X11 driver: https://github.com/grate-driver/xf86-video-opentegra
  - 3D driver: https://github.com/grate-driver/grate

Other than that, there's also support for display memory bandwidth
management for various generations and a bit of cleanup.
